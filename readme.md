# Qvain

## Introduction

Qvain is a web service for description of metadata based on a [JSON schema](http://json-schema.org/). It is developed by the [National Library of Finland](https://www.kansalliskirjasto.fi/en) as part of the [FairData](https://fairdata.fi/) project.

This is the super-repository, linking together the [Vue web application](https://github.com/NatLibFi/qvain-js/) and [Go API](https://github.com/NatLibFi/qvain-api/) repositories as submodules. You can find more information on the individual parts at their respective repositories.
