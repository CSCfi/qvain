# Qvain

## Introduction

Qvain is a web service for description of metadata based on a [JSON schema](http://json-schema.org/). It is developed by the [National Library of Finland](https://www.kansalliskirjasto.fi/en) as part of the [FairData](https://fairdata.fi/) project.

This is the super-repository, linking together the [Vue web application](qvain-js/) and [Go API](qvain-api/) as submodules.
